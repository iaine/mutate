# Web Extensions


Two browser extensions to support experiments into looking at 
how the browser interfaces are constructed from types. 

### Mutate

This extension uses the Mutation Observer event to listen to changes
in the web browser and sonifies them. 

### Events

This extension listens to the background requests and the UI interactions
to sonify the changes.
